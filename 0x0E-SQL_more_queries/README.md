##Introduction to the MySQL GRANT statement
*The CREATE USER statement creates a user account with no privileges. It means that the user account can log in to the MySQL Server, but cannot do anything such as selecting a database and querying data from tables.

*To enable the user account to work with database objects, you need to grant it privileges. You use the GRANT statement to assign one or more privileges to the user account.

*Hereâ€™s the basic syntax of the GRANT statement:

### steps 
- First, specify one or more privileges after the GRANT keyword. If you grant multiple privileges, you need to separate privileges by commas.
- Second, specify the privilege_level, which determines the extent to which the privileges apply. More information on privilege levels will be provided shortly.
- Third, specify the account name of the user you want to grant privileges after the TO keyword.
